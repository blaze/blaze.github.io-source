# Pelican plugin for blogging with IPython Notebooks

## Requirements

Python 2.7 and 3.4 are supported

Recommended version of libraries are:

- `pelican==3.5`
- `ipython==3.0`
- `markdown==2.6.1`

There is a chance the plugin will work correctly with older version but it is not guarantied.

## CSS note

There might be some issues/conflicts regarding the CSS that IPython Notebook requires and the pelican theme.

I make my best to make the plugin work with every theme but for obvious reasons I cannot guarantee that it will look good in any pelican theme.

I only try this plugin on the pelican theme for my blog: [middle theme](https://github.com/danielfrg/middle-theme) while making it the most general and useful out of the box as possible, a difficult compromise sometimes.

IPython Notebook is based on bootstrap so you probably will need your theme to be based on that it if you want the html and css to render nicely.

I try to inject only the necessary CSS, removing IPython's bootstrap but fixes are needed in some cases, if you find this issues I recommend looking at how my theme fixes them.

## Installation

Put the plugin (`__init__.py` and `ipynb.py`) inside the `pelican_project/plugins/ipynb` directory.

Then in the `pelicanconf.py`:
```
MARKUP = ('md', 'ipynb')

PLUGIN_PATH = './plugins'
PLUGINS = ['ipynb']
```

If you host your site on github pages (or just git) you could use it as a submodule:

```
git submodule add git://github.com/danielfrg/pelican-ipynb.git plugins/ipynb
```

## How to use it

### Option 1 (recommended)

Write the post using the IPython notebook interface, using markdown, equations, etc.

Place the `.ipynb` file in the content folder and create a new file with the
same name as the ipython notebook with extension `.ipynb-meta`. So you should have:
`my_post.ipynb` and `my_post.ipynb-meta`

The `ipynb-meta` should have the regular markdown metadata (note the empty line at the end, you need that):

```
Title:
Slug:
Date:
Category:
Tags:
Author:
Summary:

```

### Option 2

Open the `.ipynb` file in a text editor and should see.

```
{
    "metadata": {
        "name": "Super IPython NB"
    },
{ A_LOT_OF_OTHER_STUFF }
```

Add the metadata in the `metadata` field like this:

```
{
 "metadata": {
        "name": "Super IPython NB",
        "Title": "Blogging with IPython notebooks in pelican",
        "Date": "2013-2-16",
        "Category": "Category",
        "Tags": "tag2, tag2",
        "slug": "slug-slug-slug",
        "Author": "Me"
    },
    { A_LOT_OF_OTHER_STUFF }
```

## Options

You can include an `#ignore` comment anywhere in a cell of the ipython notebook
to ignore it, removing it from the post content.

On the `pelicanconf.py` you can use:

- `IPYNB_USE_META_SUMMARY`: boolean variable to use the summary provided in the `.ipynb-meta` file instead of creating it from the notebook.
- `IPYNB_STOP_SUMMARY_TAGS`: list of tuple with the html tag and attribute (python HTMLParser format)
when the summary creation should stop, this is usefull to generate valid/shorter summaries.
`default = [('div', ('class', 'input')), ('div', ('class', 'output'))]`
- `IPYNB_EXTEND_STOP_SUMMARY_TAGS`: list of tuples to extend the default `IPYNB_STOP_SUMMARY_TAGS`
## TODO

Toggable cells: javascript code is easy but I am not sure about the how the UI should look.
